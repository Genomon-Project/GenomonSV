For the result

1. integrate the infromation of improper short reads
2. addition of non-matched normal filter (for removing common germline SV and other artifacts easily)
3. addition of Fisher's exact test or other simple filtering method?? 
(evaluate the allele frequency of SV in matched normal sample and filter if the AF is >= 10%, e.g.). 
(for removing non-common germline SV)
4. ebCall (this is a bit minor...?) 


For efficiency

1. use pysam package (in the long run, hstlib) for extracting junction supporting short reads
2. organize the format for junction supporting short reads (especially, add the information on the relathionship with the pair reads)
(This is important for communitating with K. Chiba for extending this program so that it can capture short tandem duplications)
3. use destruct package (make the intermediate output binary)
4. use pytabix package effectively for extracting the location information
5. organize the format for the merged break point information (candidate SVs)
