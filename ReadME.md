# ebStruct

## Introduction

This is a repoistory for a new structural variation detection program.
The name ebStruct is still tentative. But I'm considering to use some empirical bayesian framework
(Like EBCall, we perform some filter with Beta-Binomial artifact distribution from the many non-matched normal samples).


## Programs

## getJunction.sh

Extract short reads having break points in them, possibly supporting SVs.

## getImproperPair.sh

Extract discordantly aligned short reads possibly supporting SVs.
